# RoboApp
* A fully responsive RoboApp built using React as part of Andrei Neagoie's ZeroToMastery 'The Complete Web Developer' course. I thoroughly enjoyed building this app as it introduced me to the power of React and the ease at which styling can be applied by using a library such as Tachyons.
* Technologies used:
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Front-End Javascript Library
  * [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) - CSS Toolkit
